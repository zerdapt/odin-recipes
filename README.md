## Creating a Recipe Webpage in HTML

In this task, we created a simple HTML document to represent a **brownie recipe**. The goal was to structure the content semantically using standard HTML elements such as:

- `<h1>` for the main recipe title
- `<ul>` and `<ol>` for ingredients and instructions
- `<section>` for logical content grouping
- `<em>` and `<strong>` for emphasis where appropriate

The content was based on the **"Best Homemade Brownies"** recipe from [loveandlemons.com](https://www.loveandlemons.com/brownies-recipe/), and we translated the key recipe components (title, prep time, ingredients, instructions, notes) into clean and readable HTML markup.

This is a useful practice for learning how to:
- Structure content semantically
- Represent real-world data in HTML
- Work with lists and text formatting for clarity and accessibility
